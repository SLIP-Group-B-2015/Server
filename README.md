# Server
Contains files to run the server.

We use python's Flask for the web pages (http://flask.pocoo.org/) and ngrok for exposing the service to the internet (https://ngrok.com/).

Flask should be installed on the UoE linux machines (else install it on your own machine), all you need to is activate the server environment by changing to the repository directory containing venv and type "source venv/bin/activate" then you can use "python <filename>" to execute code.
